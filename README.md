# Wildcard Arguments
- When you don't know how many arguments to pass in a function
- Non-keyword arguments; *argument
- Keyword arguments; **argument

# Modules
- One of the techniques for following DRY Coding Principles
- Group similar codes and functions together in a separate file
- Solves the problem of code file being too lengthy and complex
- Can be reused across several programs
- Python comes with a lot of modules as well, Pythons Standard Library.

# Packages
- Collection of modules
- Organise related modules under one directory
- Initialise a package using __init__.py file

## Practical Example
Task:
- Create a package for basic text processing with modules for:
    - Counting words in a string,
    - Counting characters in a string, and
    - Reversing strings.

# Slicing a sequence
- Way to extract parts of data structures, like strings, lists, tuples, etc.
- Syntax: sequence[start:stop:step] (like range)
- Default of start : 0, Default of step : 1

# Object Oriented Programming
- It is a way to help programmers structure the functionality of your porgram that would make sense to humans and would allow computers to run it efficiently.
- Almost all programming languages use this concept.
- It uses "objects" to model real-world entities.

## Key Concepts
- Class
    - A blueprint for creating objects
    - Defines a set of attributes or methods that the created objects (instances) will have
    - e.g. Blueprint provided while building a house, defining what an animal is
- Object
    - An instance of a class.
    - It represents a specific entity with attributes (data) and methods (functions) defined by class.
    - e.g. A built house with many features (as functions)
    - e.g. class_eg(Dog)
    - e.g. Bank account
- Four Pillars of OOP
    - Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism
